The problem using scanf is that you wouldnt be able to check for a single input like "0" because it always waits for all expected inputs before parsing.
This means we have to create our own parser, also one annoyance of scanf is that when reading a char it keeps the "Enter" character in the input buffer.

fgets and sscanf are circumventing these problems, fgets takes a single input stream (stdin in this case).
After that it's easy to parse and check for errors using sscanf.
