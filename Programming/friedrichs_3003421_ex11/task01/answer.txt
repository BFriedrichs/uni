FIX_A:
  - Vector reallocates if its larger than it was before but the iterator stays at old position.
  So we get the difference from beginning to insert position before we do the insert and then add it again after.

  - Deque invalidates all iterators after an insert so we have to do the same thing to get our desired result.

FIX_B:
  - For all cases just take the returned iterator minus one to get to the position before the insert and proceed from there.
