 * My computer requires ~0.45 seconds to execute Copy assignment test 10000 times
 * My computer requires ~0.15 seconds to execute Move assignment test 10000 times

I can see quite a difference in computing time because the move commands are a lot faster.
The reason for this behaviour is simple, a copy actually needs to allocate new
memory on the heap while the move just switches pointers.
